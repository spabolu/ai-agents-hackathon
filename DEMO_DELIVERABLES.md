## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Server won't start
**Symptom:** Port 8000 already in use
**Solution:**
```bash
kill $(lsof -ti:8000)
./demo_quickstart.sh
```

### Issue 2: Dependencies missing
**Symptom:** Import errors when running scripts
**Solution:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Issue 3: Tests failing
**Symptom:** test_business_logic.py shows failures
**Solution:** Demo can still run in DEMO_MODE (uses pre-cached responses)
```bash
grep DEMO_MODE .env  # Verify DEMO_MODE=True
```

### Issue 4: DEMO_MODE not enabled
**Symptom:** API calls are slow or fail
**Solution:**
```bash
echo "DEMO_MODE=True" >> .env
# Restart server
```

### Issue 5: API endpoints not responding
**Symptom:** curl commands return errors
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check server logs in Terminal 1
# Verify DEMO_MODE=True in .env
# Run health check: ./demo_healthcheck.sh
```
