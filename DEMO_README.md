**Aura Cold Brew Autonomous Brand Agent**
**AI Agents Hackathon - October 4, 2025**

---

## 📋 Pre-Demo Checklist (5 minutes before presentation)

- [ ] Two terminal windows ready
- [ ] Internet connection verified
- [ ] Power adapter connected (laptop)
- [ ] Font size increased for visibility
- [ ] Timer/stopwatch ready (3-minute countdown)
- [ ] DEMO_SCRIPT.md reviewed and memorized

## 🎬 Step-by-Step Demo Execution

### Terminal 1: Launch Server

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/jack/coding-m1mbp-july-2025/_agent_hackathon_1004/primary-build/ai-agents-hackathon

# Run quickstart script
./demo_quickstart.sh
```

**This script will:**
1. ✅ Check Python installation
2. ✅ Install/verify uv package manager
3. ✅ Create/activate virtual environment
4. ✅ Install all dependencies
5. ✅ Verify .env configuration (DEMO_MODE=True)
6. ✅ Run business logic tests (10/10 should pass)
7. ✅ Start FastAPI server on http://localhost:8000
8. ✅ Display demo instructions

**Expected output:** Server running, instructions displayed

---

### Terminal 2: Execute Demo Commands

**Wait for Terminal 1 to show "DEMO IS READY" message, then:**

```bash
# In a NEW terminal window
cd /Users/jack/coding-m1mbp-july-2025/_agent_hackathon_1004/primary-build/ai-agents-hackathon

# Run demo execution script
./demo_execute.sh
```

**This script will:**
- Guide you through the 3-minute demo step-by-step
- Show timing for each section
- Display talking points
- Execute API calls automatically
- Show expected responses
- Provide Q&A preparation

**Expected output:** Guided demo with prompts at each step

## ⚡ Quick Commands (Manual Demo)

If you prefer to run commands manually instead of using `demo_execute.sh`:

### Demo 1: Competitive Response (0:30-1:15)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/generate-response-ad \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"competitor_ad_text": "Red Bull gives you wings! Energy all day."}'
```

### Demo 2: Opportunity Discovery (1:15-2:15)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/generate_opportunity_campaign \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "city": "Austin",
    "brand_rules": "Premium cold brew, sustainability-focused, young professionals"
  }'
```

### Health Check

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/
```

### API Documentation (Browser)

```bash
open http://localhost:8000/docs
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Server won't start

```bash
# Check if port 8000 is already in use
lsof -ti:8000

# Kill existing process on port 8000
kill $(lsof -ti:8000)

# Restart quickstart script
./demo_quickstart.sh
```

### Dependencies missing

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Reinstall dependencies
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Tests failing

```bash
# Run tests manually to see details
python test_business_logic.py
```

**If tests fail:** Demo can still run in DEMO_MODE (uses pre-cached responses)

### DEMO_MODE not working

```bash
# Verify DEMO_MODE in .env
grep DEMO_MODE .env

# Should show: DEMO_MODE=True

# If not, update it:
echo "DEMO_MODE=True" >> .env
```

## 📊 Demo Flow Summary

| Time | Section | Duration | Action |
|------|---------|----------|--------|
| **0:00-0:30** | Problem Hook | 30s | Explain the problem (3 weeks vs 60 seconds) |
| **0:30-1:15** | Demo 1 | 45s | Execute competitive response curl command |
| **1:15-2:15** | Demo 2 | 60s | Execute opportunity discovery curl command |
| **2:15-2:45** | Tech Stack | 30s | Mention 5 sponsor tools + architecture |
| **2:45-3:00** | Impact & Close | 15s | Deliver impact statement + thank judges |

## 🎯 Key Talking Points

### Problem (0:00-0:30)
> "Traditional marketing takes 3+ weeks to respond to competitors. We do it in 60 seconds - fully automated, on-brand, and culturally aware."

### Demo 1 Highlight (0:30-1:15)
> "Notice the 95% confidence score - our agent self-evaluates and only auto-approves high-quality responses."

### Demo 2 Highlight (1:15-2:15)
> "This is true autonomy - the agent discovered a real Austin event via Linkup, generated culturally-relevant copy via TrueFoundry, and created professional imagery via Freepik - zero human intervention."

### Technical (2:15-2:45)
> "5 sponsor tools: Linkup, TrueFoundry, Freepik, DeepL, ClickHouse. Production-ready FastAPI with async architecture."

### Close (2:45-3:00)
> "10x faster. Culturally aware. Fully autonomous. This isn't just automation - it's marketing sentience. Thank you!"

---

## 💡 Backup Strategies

### If Live API is slow:
> "This is hitting live APIs - in production we'd cache responses. Let me show you the DEMO_MODE instant response..."

### If API fails:
> "Let me show our backup response..." [Show screenshot from DEMO_SCRIPT.md]

### If judges ask to see code:
```bash
# Open VS Code to main.py
code main.py

# Or show API schema
open http://localhost:8000/docs
```

## 📋 Q&A Preparation

**Q: "How does this handle different languages?"**
> "DeepL is integrated. We generate in English, detect target market language, translate with professional formality, and return localized copy. The `/generate_opportunity_campaign` endpoint can be extended to include translation."

**Q: "What if the agent generates offensive content?"**
> "Multi-layer safety: TrueFoundry/GPT models have built-in content filters, our brand guidelines constrain outputs, confidence scoring flags uncertain responses, and all outputs are logged in ClickHouse for audit."

**Q: "How do you measure success?"**
> "We track response time (<60s target), confidence scores (>85% for auto-approval), brand alignment via embedding similarity, and optional A/B testing of generated vs human-created ads."

**Q: "This seems like demo mode - does it really work live?"**
> "Yes! DEMO_MODE=True just returns pre-cached responses for demo reliability. Set DEMO_MODE=False in .env and it makes real API calls. I can demonstrate..." [Switch if time allows]
